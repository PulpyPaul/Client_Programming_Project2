For the Above and Beyond in this project, I added extra content in 4 areas....

1) Extra jQuery plug-ins: The requirement was 3 plug-ins and I used 4 in my project. I used the Button, Accordion, Tabs, and Modal Dialog.
(Along with obviously the Google Map requirement)

2) Responsive Design: Rather than having a completely static webpage, I spent a lot of time formatting the entire webpage to work with
varying screen sizes. If you change the width of the webpage, it still looks really good regarding the formatting. It is also important
to note that I did this with all my own css, I did not use a library to get responsive design.

3) Professional Look and Feel: I spent a lot of time to make the webpage looks professional with lots of polish. I added many features
like hover events, spent time developing my own color pallet, my own grid system, and making it feel interactive and overall nice.
I went into photoshop to creates some color pallets and layout, then developed the css/html based on those wireframes. Honestly I 
spent too much time deciding on a design and wasted a few hours trying different things until I was satisfied.

4) Chart JS library: I added the Chart JS library to display some cool statistics about the student degrees. I included 4 different types of 
charts that are dynamically built using my own functions combined with the library. Simply click on a button to rebuild the chart into a different
type, the formats includes pie, doughnut, bar, and radar.
